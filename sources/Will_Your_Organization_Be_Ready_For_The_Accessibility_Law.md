WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1. Perceivable: Images have alts 
2. Operable: All content is operable by keyboard
3. Understandable: Page language is correct
4. Robust: Roles

- B2C NOT B2B
- WCAG conformance levels:
	- A = minimal
	- AA = mid-range
	- AAA = advanced
- WAD (Web Accessibility Directive)  vs EAA (European Accessibility Act)
- 5 years grace period BUT new applications/ big features will have to comply immediately
	â€¢ *Note: Check how this will work for big features and what features qualify as big.*
- Accessible websites improve SEO ranking (alt texts and captions)
- Accessibility statement:
	- Compliance state
	- Contact information
	- Feedback procedure
- PDF accessibility is also required with it's own set of requirements
	- *Note: Check if this will be part of the new law.*
