Different types of disabilities:

Because it touches on things like keyboard support, alt texts

# Images (Alt-text) is classic
- What alt text to give something?
	- Depends on relevance
- Alt-texts are critical for SEO

# Hamburger menus are usually not accessible
- Often forgotten
- Also place tags on mobile

# Content placed out of the way, won't get found
Make sure content can be seen (or read) on the screen (not hidden away in code)

# Accessibility testing with users can reveal huge gaps
Code reviews are not enough
- Accessibility testing will indicate more issues

# Disabling zoom on mobile makes it inaccessible

# Accessibility is easily learned
- Cheaper to do up front
- Incorporate in designs

# Accessibility does not mean ugly
- Though layout rethinking
- Strategic placement of links

# Check mobile accessibility separately
Avoid collapse/ expand

# Embrace the accessibility attitude
- Use persona's
